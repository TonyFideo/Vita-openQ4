# Contributing to openQ4

Thank you for your interest in helping make openQ4 a complete, open-source
replacement for the Quake 4 engine and game code. Bug reports, compatibility
reports, testing feedback, documentation improvements, and code contributions are
all welcome.

If you just want to play, you do **not** need to build from source — download the
latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/themuffinator/openQ4/releases).

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Before opening a new issue, please search [existing
issues](https://github.com/themuffinator/openQ4/issues) to avoid duplicates.

When filing a bug report, include as much of the following as possible:

- The openQ4 version or commit SHA you are running.
- Your operating system, CPU architecture, GPU, and driver version.
- Whether you are using a release package or a local build.
- Clear steps to reproduce the problem.
- The expected behavior and what actually happened.
- Relevant excerpts from `openq4.log` (located under
  `fs_savepath/<gameDir>/logs/openq4.log`; the default path is usually
  `.home/baseoq4/logs/openq4.log` when launching from the repo).
- For crashes, include the crash log, minidump, or stack trace if available.

If your report is for a preview or experimental platform (Linux ARM64 and macOS
are previews; Windows ARM64 is experimental), please use the corresponding issue
template so the right context is captured up front. A report that everything
worked is useful evidence for those platforms, not only bug reports.

### Reporting Compatibility Issues

openQ4 targets the official Quake 4 retail assets and ships its own engine and
game modules. When reporting a compatibility problem:

- Confirm the issue reproduces with the original base PK4s, not only with custom
  content or third-party mods.
- Note whether the problem is specific to single-player, multiplayer, dedicated
  server, or a particular map.
- Avoid relying on repo-side `q4base/` overrides when validating; the long-term
  goal is to run cleanly with the original assets alone.

### Suggesting Features or Improvements

Feature suggestions are best opened as issues with the `[Request]` or
`[Enhancement]` prefix. To help discussion:

- Explain the player or developer benefit.
- Describe how it relates to stock-asset compatibility or project goals.
- Mention any prior art from Quake 4, the SDK, or other id Tech 4-based projects.

Please understand that openQ4 values compatibility with the shipped Quake 4
assets. Proposals that would break stock-map behavior or fragment the player base
will need extra justification.

### Contributing Code

1. Fork the repository and create a topic branch for your change.
2. Make focused commits with clear messages.
3. Follow the [Development Workflow](#development-workflow) and [Style and
   Conventions](#style-and-conventions) below.
4. Open a pull request referencing any related issue.

## Development Workflow

### Prerequisites

See [BUILDING.md](../BUILDING.md) for the full platform-specific requirements.
In short:

- **Windows:** MSVC 19.46+ and Meson 1.6.0+. Use `tools/build/meson_setup.ps1`
  from a regular PowerShell window instead of invoking `meson` directly.
- **Linux:** GCC 13+ or Clang 17+, Meson 1.6.0+, and Ninja.
- **macOS (preview):** Xcode 16+ / Clang 17+, Meson 1.6.0+, and Ninja.

### Building

See [BUILDING.md](../BUILDING.md) for detailed instructions. A typical local
build on Linux looks like:

```bash
meson setup builddir
meson compile -C builddir
meson install -C builddir --no-rebuild --skip-subprojects
```

On Windows, use the wrapper to ensure the MSVC toolchain is available:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/build/meson_setup.ps1 setup builddir
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/build/meson_setup.ps1 compile -C builddir
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/build/meson_setup.ps1 install -C builddir --no-rebuild --skip-subprojects
```

### Project Structure Notes

- **Engine code:** lives under `src/`.
- **Game code:** maintained in the companion repository
  [openQ4-game](https://github.com/themuffinator/openQ4-game). Do not mirror
  game-library sources under `src/game/` in this repository.
- **BSE code:** lives under `src/bse/` and is treated as first-party openQ4
  code. BSE is built into the client executable.
- **Runtime overrides:** authored overrides belong under `content/baseoq4/`. The
  `.install/baseoq4/` directory is the staged output, not an editing target.
- **Build output:** use `builddir/` for local development artifacts and
  `.install/` for staged runtime packages.

### Before Submitting a Pull Request

- Build your change locally and confirm the project still compiles.
- Run the relevant mode-specific launch task (SP for single-player, MP for
  multiplayer) and enter gameplay on a map affected by your change; main-menu
  startup alone is not sufficient validation.
- Check `fs_savepath/<gameDir>/logs/openq4.log` for new warnings or errors.
- Update documentation if your change affects player-facing behavior, build
  steps, or technical assumptions.
- Add or update release-note material in `docs/dev/release-completion.md` when
  the change is user-facing, packaging-related, or platform-related. Curated
  release notes for a version cut belong in `docs/dev/releases/vX.Y.Z.md`.
- Keep commits focused and rebased on the latest default branch when practical.

## Style and Conventions

- Match the existing style of the file you are editing.
- Prefer cross-platform abstractions through SDL3 rather than introducing new
  platform-specific code in shared engine paths.
- Do not add hardcoded user-facing UI strings when a `#str_*` localization lookup
  is possible.
- Avoid adding engine-side content files (materials, shaders, GUIs) unless
  absolutely required for compatibility. Prefer engine-side defaults or
  generated resources.
- Keep `baseoq4/` as the single unified game directory; do not split
  single-player and multiplayer into separate mod folders.
- Do not reintroduce an external `openQ4-BSE_<arch>` runtime module; BSE stays
  linked into the client executable.
- Maintain accurate credits and add new upstream attributions whenever you
  incorporate external work.
