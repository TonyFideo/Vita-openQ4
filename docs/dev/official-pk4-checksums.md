# Official Quake 4 PK4 Checksums (q4base)

This table captures the PK4 checksums loaded from official installed game directories:

- Primary install path: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Quake 4\q4base`
- Additional source: issue #54 startup log from a Spanish physical/DVD install
- Log source: `logs/openq4.log` startup lines (`Loaded pk4 ... with checksum ...`) under `fs_savepath\<gameDir>\`
- Checksum format: engine PK4 checksum (`MD4` of zip-entry CRC list, as computed in `src/framework/FileSystem.cpp`)

openQ4 ignores the retail game-binary PK4 archives (`game000.pk4` through `game300.pk4`, plus `gamex*.pk4` variants) as loadable content because it ships its own game modules. They are not required, mounted, or content-verified. The one retained checksum value described below is a network compatibility token, not a requirement to install or trust the archive.

## Pure multiplayer game-module token

openQ4's network protocol, 2.41, carries a game-code PK4 checksum after the ordered pure asset list. That version number is Doom 3's minor number under Quake 4's major number; no retail Quake 4 release used it. openQ4 fills the field with a fixed token for the Windows, Linux, and macOS OS IDs: `0x68fb90b1`, the engine checksum of the official Quake 4 1.4.2 `q4base/game300.pk4`. The same value is used on every platform, so an openQ4 client and server do not need identical executable formats to complete the asset handshake.

The token only works between openQ4 builds. It does not make openQ4 compatible with retail servers, for two reasons:

- Retail 1.4.2 servers speak protocol 2.85 and reject a 2.41 client before the pure check.
- `q4base/game300.pk4` holds the single-player game code. Since 1.4.0, retail multiplayer runs from `q4mp/`, so a retail pure server expects a `q4mp` game pak:

| PK4 | Checksum | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `q4mp/game300.pk4` | `0xe9732a13` | Windows, Linux, and macOS multiplayer game code |
| `q4mp/game000.pk4` | `0x540bbe81` | Windows multiplayer game code |
| `q4mp/game100.pk4` | `0x11cd8117` | Linux multiplayer game code |
| `q4mp/game200.pk4` | `0x34249b52` | macOS multiplayer game code |

The value is only a protocol compatibility token. openQ4 does not open, extract, download, restart into, or execute `game300.pk4`. It accepts the token only when a game module has already been resolved from the trusted local openQ4 package/module roots; a missing local module or any other token fails the pure handshake as unavailable game code. The ordered retail/openQ4 asset PK4 list is still checked separately.

`0x68fb90b1` is not a hash of the loaded openQ4 module, cryptographic attestation, or an anti-cheat guarantee. It only keeps the field populated with a stable value; executable trust remains a local packaging decision.

## Required official baseline

These core retail media PK4s are required by openQ4 startup validation (`fs_validateOfficialPaks 1`, default):

| PK4 | Checksum |
|---|---|
| `pak001.pk4` | `0xf2cbc998` |
| `pak002.pk4` | `0x7f8d80d1` |
| `pak003.pk4` | `0x1b57b207` |
| `pak004.pk4` | `0x385aa578` |
| `pak005.pk4` | `0x60d50a1d` |
| `pak006.pk4` | `0x9099ed11` |
| `pak007.pk4` | `0xaf301fff` |
| `pak008.pk4` | `0x4ac6f6d9` |
| `pak009.pk4` | `0x36030c7d` |
| `pak010.pk4` | `0x4b80fbda` |
| `pak011.pk4` | `0x8acf4cfa` |
| `pak012.pk4` | `0xbe4120b0` |

| `pak015.pk4` | `0xf5bf4e0c` |
| `pak016.pk4` | `0x2196f58c` |
| `pak017.pk4` | `0x91118a35` |
| `pak018.pk4` | `0x98a14f03` |
| `pak019.pk4` | `0xbc82ac79` |
| `pak020.pk4` | `0xce74cda5` |
| `pak021.pk4` | `0x2ba6e70c` |
| `pak022.pk4` | `0x4e390eec` |

## Optional official PK4s detected

These PK4s are recognized when present, but missing files do not block startup. `pak023.pk4` through `pak025.pk4` contain official patch/menu splash media rather than core campaign or multiplayer assets required by openQ4.

At least one unsuffixed `zpak_<language>.pk4` base archive is needed for character dialogue: the shared `pak001.pk4` through `pak022.pk4` baseline contains the sound declarations and lip-sync data, but not the localized voice audio itself. Numbered files such as `zpak_english_01.pk4` are patch archives and do not replace that base media. Client startup warns when no recognized unsuffixed retail language-pack filename is mounted. This check identifies the known language name and base filename; it does not claim that the archive contents are complete. The absence remains non-fatal so dedicated servers and alternate physical/localized editions are not tied to one specific language archive or checksum.
