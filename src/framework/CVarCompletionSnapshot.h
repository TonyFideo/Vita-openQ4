/*
===============================================================================

	CVar value-completion snapshots, engine only. CVarSystem.h is mirrored into
	the game modules, so this stays out of it.

	The idCmdSystem::ArgCompletion_* helpers are inline, so every binary has
	its own copy, and registering a static cvar points its value completion at
	the declaring binary's copy. That includes the cvars a module shares with
	the engine or another module, so a renderer module's GetRenderAPI takes
	over every callback it declares. Once the module is unloaded they point at
	unmapped code, and the console calls a cvar's completion while its name
	and a space are typed.

	Capture before a module registers its cvars and Restore before it is
	unloaded. Restore gives every cvar the callback it had at Capture, and
	clears it on cvars that had none then, the module's own among them. A
	snapshot that was never captured restores nothing, rather than clearing
	every callback.
