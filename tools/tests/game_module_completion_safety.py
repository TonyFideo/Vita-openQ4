"""A game module unload must not leave cvar completions pointing into it.

The idCmdSystem::ArgCompletion_* helpers are inline, so every binary carries
its own copy, and registering a static cvar points its value completion at the
declaring binary's copy. A game module's GetGameAPI registers all of its static
cvars, so it takes over the completion of every cvar it declares, the ones it
shares with the engine and the renderer included, and its ShutdownAfterDecls
clears only the CVAR_GAME ones. After reloadGameModule swapped game_sp for
game_mp, bot_showstate, bot_pathdebug and four g_render* cvars, which game-sp
declares without CVAR_GAME and game-mp does not declare at all, kept
completions inside the unloaded game-sp. The console calls a cvar's completion
while its name and a space are typed.

The engine captures the completions as soon as it has loaded a game module
and puts them back before it unloads it, so a declaration that leaves out
CVAR_GAME is covered however it gets there. Sys_DLL_Unload therefore has one
call site in Common.cpp, behind the restore, and the one load site captures
before GetGameAPI. The restore semantics themselves are pinned by
renderer_module_completion_safety.py.
